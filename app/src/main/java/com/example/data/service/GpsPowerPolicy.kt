/**
 * Pure decision logic for movement-triggered location power saving.
 *
 * Rule (owner spec): while the phone is moving, location (GPS) stays on.
 * When movement stops, it stays on for a short grace period, then turns off.
 * While the phone is still, location is switched on for a brief refresh pulse
 * about every few minutes so apps get a fresh fix.
 *
 * This class holds no Android dependencies so the timing rules are unit-tested
 * directly. The controller layer supplies the clock and applies the result.
